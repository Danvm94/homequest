## **Agile Planning for Homequest**

This project was developed using agile methodologies, focusing on delivering
small features across the project's duration. User Stories were prioritized
under the labels "Must Have," "Should Have," and "Could Have."

This approach ensured that all essential requirements for Homequest were
addressed initially, providing a comprehensive foundation for the project. In
certain cases, some "Could Have" features were implemented ahead of schedule,
particularly if they were straightforward, such as Trending/Top Rated
Properties. Other features were integrated based on available capacity and
timing.

The project utilized a Kanban board created on GitHub projects, which can be
accessed [here](https://github.com/users/Danvm94/projects/5). This board
provided detailed information about project cards. All User Stories included a
set of acceptance criteria to define the functionality required for story
completion.
